I have been playing most weekends on the road with Shotgun Rider, a Texas Country group originally from the
Panhandle region of West Texas now based in Fort Worth, TX.  Check them out [here](http://www.shotgunridermusic.com).
Their new album, 'Palo Duro', will be released on March 30th under the Thirty Tigers label.
